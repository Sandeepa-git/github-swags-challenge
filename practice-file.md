### Example Entry

**Added by:** John Doe  
**Topic:** JavaScript Async/Await  
**Content:** Learning async/await has made handling asynchronous operations much cleaner than using callbacks or promises alone.

### My Contribution 1

**Added by:** Sandeepa Wimalasiri  
**Topic:** Python File Handling  
**Content:** Learning file handling in Python helps automate reading and writing data. Using `with open()` ensures files are properly closed, reducing errors and improving code readability.

```python
# Python example
with open('example.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write("Hello Git practice!")
````

### My Contribution 2

**Added by:** Sandeepa Wimalasiri
**Topic:** JavaScript Async/Await
**Content:** Learning async/await makes handling asynchronous operations cleaner than using callbacks or promises alone.

```javascript
// JavaScript example
async function greetLearner(name) {
    return `Hello ${name}, keep learning Git!`;
}
```

### My Contribution 3

**Added by:** Sandeepa Wimalasiri
**Topic:** HTML Git Practice
**Content:** Adding simple HTML helps visualize learning progress and create interactive examples.

```html
<!-- HTML example -->
<div class="git-practice">
    <h1>Learning Git is Fun!</h1>
</div>
```

### My Contribution 4

**Added by:** Sandeepa Wimalasiri
**Topic:** React Hooks - useState
**Content:** The `useState` hook in React allows functional components to manage state easily without using class components.

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🎪 Fun Challenges

### Challenge 1: Multiple Commits

* Make 4 separate commits for each contribution
* Each commit should have a descriptive message

### Challenge 2: Branch Naming

* Create branches with meaningful names like:

  * `feature/add-python-section`
  * `feature/add-js-async`
  * `feature/add-html-example`
  * `feature/add-react-hooks`

### Challenge 3: Commit Message Practice

Good commit messages:

* `Add section about Python file handling`
* `Add JavaScript async/await example`
* `Add HTML code snippet`
* `Add React useState hook example`

Bad commit messages:

* `changes`
* `update`
* `fix`
